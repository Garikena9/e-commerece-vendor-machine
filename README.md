# e-commerece-vendor-machine
â€¢	Ecommerce vendor management system (IIIT-Hyderabad, Great learning)

The project mimics a management system where each authorized vendor can use his credentials to login and insert, 
retrieve the product information that they have added. 
The idea is to mimic a simple CRUD operation on a product information dictionary that was created individually for each vendor.
